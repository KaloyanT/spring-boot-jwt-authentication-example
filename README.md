Spring Boot JWT Authentication Example
== 

This is an example Spring Boot project which shows how you can secure your (RESTful) APIs with JWT Tokens. The project doesn't use OAuth 
or other similar authentication protocols. The JWT Tokens currently don't follow the "Bearer" scheme, but the project will be updated and they will
eventually follow it. 

The Documentation is also coming soon. 

## Requirements: 
1. Java SDK 1.8
2. Maven
